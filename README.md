# 3DCADFusion
This is a python/CUDA implementation of the "3DCADFusion: Tracking and 3D Reconstruction of Dynamic Objects without External Motion Information" paper. The system is capable of producing dense reconstructions of objects by tracking and reconstructing their incrementally improving 3D geometry in a sequence of RGBD-D or luminance-depth frames.
